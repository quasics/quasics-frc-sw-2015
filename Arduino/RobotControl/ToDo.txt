Things that should be done:

* Consolidate code between the two serial-oriented controllers
(NeoPixelSerialController and NeoPixelUSBController).  There's some largely
duplicate stuff in there that could be better managed.

* Try to eliminate the dependency on having a Mega, by conditionally disabling
the use of Serial1.  Similarly, try *expanding* support to include other
serial ports when they are available on a board.

* Formatting clean-up.
