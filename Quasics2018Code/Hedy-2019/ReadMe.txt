This is a version of the "Hedy" robot code from the 2018 competition season
that has been converted to the 2019 tools using the "WPILib: Import a
WPILib Eclipse project" function.

This is not intended for competition purposes, but instead to provide a
build of the code that can be used for driving practice with a Rio that has
been upgraded to the 2019 firmware.
