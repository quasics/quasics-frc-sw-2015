 * Tells the elevator (to use PID-based control) to move to a specified height.
 * 
 * Note that this is a "set it and done" sort of command, since *all* the
 * command needs to do is to configure the target position for the elevator.
 * Once that's been done, the PID logic on the elevator (or a simulated version
 * of it, at least) should continue driving the elevator subsystem to the
 * specified position.
 * 
 * Note also, however, that if there's some other command configured as the
 * default on the elevator (e.g., something that reads a joystick control for
 * height, etc.), then that could conflict with this approach.
