# Simulation

Unlike for differential drives, WPILib doesn't appear to provide direct support for simulating a swerve drive,
though they do include [sample code](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/tree/main/wpilibjExamples/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/examples/swervebot)
for *physical* hardware in the examples.

As a result, there's been various discussions on CD for how to get support for this in place:
