# Lighting Profile

## Color (Team and Communications Status)
   * Competition:
      * Red Team: Red
      * Blue Team: Blue
   * Demo: Green
   * No Communications/ E stopped: Yellow and blinking quickly (note that
     this overrides the patterns involved with "status")

## Battery Indicator:
   * Below 12 volts for 10 seconds (as identified by the Rio): Yellow as a mix-in (see below)
   * Otherwise: Nominal

## Status
   * Disabled: "Breathing"
   * Enabled:
      * Auto: Solid
      * Operator Control: Blinking slowly
      * Test: Medium blink

## Comments
   * When in low-voltage mode, we'll include the yellow as a brief pulse (e.g.,
     when we "go dark" at the end of a blink/breath, we'll flicker yellow
     briefly).
   * **Question:** Is the RoboRio going to update battery information on an
     ongoing basis?  If so, what should the Arduino do if it doesn't get
     this information: does the "battery indicator" state time out after a
     while and return to "nominal"?  (And if so, after how long?)

# Possible "wire protocol"
   * Byte 0: Command
      * Mode (color) = 0x01
      * Battery = 0x02
      * Status = 0x03
      * Heartbeat = 0xFF
   * Byte 1: Parameter (if applicable)
      * Mode:
         * Red alliance = 0x01
         * Blue alliance = 0x02
         * Demo = 0x03
         * No comms = 0x04
      * Battery:
         * Power fine: 0x01
         * Power low: 0xFF
      * Status:
         * Disabled: 0x00
         * Auto: 0x01
         * Operator control: 0x02
         * Test: 0x03
      * Heartbeat: Always 0
   * Byte 2: Checksum (to help detect transmission errors); simplest might be
     something like a longitudinal redundancy check (http://goo.gl/sI9TFq)
