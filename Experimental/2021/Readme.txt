In the 2021 build season, we were able to start using both the new "Romi"
units and the RoboRio-based "big bots".

For this season (especially given the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic meant
that much of our s/w work had to be done remotely, which made the Romis
even more useful), I worked on sample code that was somewhat portable
between the two types of units, as well as on vision processing support that
could be done for both.
