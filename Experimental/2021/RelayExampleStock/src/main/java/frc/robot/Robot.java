/**
 * This is a sample program which uses joystick buttons to control a relay. A Relay (generally a
 * spike) has two outputs, each of which can be at either 0V or 12V and so can be used for actions
 * such as turning a motor off, full forwards, or full reverse, and is generally used on the
 * compressor. This program uses two buttons on a joystick and each button corresponds to one
 * output; pressing the button sets the output to 12V and releasing sets it to 0V.
