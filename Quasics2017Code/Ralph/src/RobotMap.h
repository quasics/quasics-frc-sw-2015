/**
 * The RobotMap is a mapping from the ports sensors and actuators are wired into
 * to a variable name. This provides flexibility changing wiring, makes checking
 * the wiring easier and significantly reduces the number of magic numbers
 * floating around.
 *
 * This class was originally auto-generated via RobotBuilder, but has been modified
 * extensively since then.
