# Some things that Matt should do in this code
* Add (again) a _simple_ example of a Vision subsystem, supporting enumeration of visible targets and estimated distance/angle to each.
   * Status: in progress.  I need to finish implementing the "visible targets" stuff in the BetterVision class, and to test them for both classes.
* Add a simple "drive to target" command. :-)
