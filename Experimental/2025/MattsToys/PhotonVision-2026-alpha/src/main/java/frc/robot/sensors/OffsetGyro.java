/**
 * Wrapper around an IGyro, allowing us to reset it "locally", without affecting
 * the original gyro's data.
 * 
 * I foresee this as being useful under at least two different circumstances:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * When we're wrapping a multi-axis gyro/ALU inside of the single-axis "IGyro"
 * interface and want to be able to support resetting data for that specific
 * axis under some circumstances, without changing the others.
 * <p>
 * For example, in the 2023 game ("Charged up"), we needed to track both the
 * robot's heading (left/right rotation, or "yaw") for navigating around the
 * field, but also needed to track the "pitch" of the robot up/down in order
 * to be able to balance on the the "charging station" (think of a big see-saw),
 * and didn't want to reset one of those as a side effect of resetting the
 * other.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * When we're performing some temporally-scoped set of operations (e.g., while a
 * command is running) and want to have an easy reference point (i.e., 0)
 * without affecting the overall use of a gyro/ALU.
 * <p>
 * For example, the "real" gyro might be used on a continuous basis to maintain
 * data for odometry/pose estimation, and thus resetting the actual gyro would
 * "break" that processing. However, we might want to simplify the handling of a
 * command like "turn N degrees" by allowing the code to use 0 as a reference
 * point; wrapping an object of this class around the "real" gyro would be able
 * to support that, since resetting *this* gyro would only change *its* idea of
 * where 0 was, and wouldn't affect the "real" gyro's idea of 0.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
